Hi there! My name is Emily. I am a fullstack developer and STEAM educator.

:sunflower: I am currently learning...advanced React and Redux! And how to be a better Web Development teacher :) While also trying to create a portfolio for myself.


:mushroom: I am most interested in frontend design, but I will not be limiting myself to that. I am also interested about learning more about computer science and programming logic.
